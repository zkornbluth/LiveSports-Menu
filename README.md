# Live Sports Scores Menu Bar App
MacOS Menu Bar app to follow MLB, NFL, NHL, NBA, and Premier League game scores live. 

Inspired by [https://github.com/markolson/MLB-Menu](https://github.com/markolson/MLB-Menu) and [https://github.com/kchau/NFL-Menu](https://github.com/kchau/NFL-Menu).

In the popup, click "Open Anyway" and use Touch ID or enter your password when prompted to allow the app to open.

Note: you may also get that warning when opening the .dmg

## Using the App
All interaction is through the macOS Menu Bar. Click the baseball icon to open the app.

The app defaults to showing the current day's MLB schedule. 

The ESPN API (where the app gets the data) changes from the previous day's scoreboard to the current day's schedule usually between 9am and 11am ET (for all leagues except NFL and college football). 

The NFL and college football scoreboards are weekly, and they change to the next week's schedule on Tuesdays usually between 9am and 11am ET.

Switch to another league:
1. Click the gear in the bottom right
2. Hover over "Change Sport"
3. In the submenu, click the league name
