# Live Sports Scores Menu Bar App
MacOS Menu Bar app to follow MLB and NFL game scores live. 

Inspired by [https://github.com/markolson/MLB-Menu](https://github.com/markolson/MLB-Menu) and [https://github.com/kchau/NFL-Menu](https://github.com/kchau/NFL-Menu).

In the popup, click "Open Anyway" and use Touch ID or enter your password when prompted to allow the app to open.

Note: you may also get that warning when opening the .dmg

## Using the App
All interaction is through the macOS Menu Bar. Click the baseball icon to open the app.

The app defaults to showing the current day's MLB schedule. The ESPN API (where the app gets the data) changes from the previous day's scoreboard to the current day's schedule usually between 9am and 11am ET. The NFL scoreboard is weekly, and it changes to the next week's schedule on Tuesdays usually between 9am and 11am ET.

Switch to the current week's NFL schedule (and change the icon into a football):
1. Click the gear in the bottom right
2. Hover over "Change Sport"
3. In the submenu, click "NFL"
